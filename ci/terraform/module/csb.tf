# This data source is used in the for_each block of cloudfoundry_service_plan_visibility.csb to enable access to all plans the broker offers. Those plans are not available until the broker is created and registered. It would be best to establish a dependency on cloudfoundry_service_broker.csb so this data is only fetched after the broker is created and registered. However, terraform does not allow values that are known only after apply to be used in a for_each block. Adding the dependency causes the plan to fail with this error. As a result, we cannot establish a dependency in terraform. If you have created a new plan, you may need to run apply twice -- once to create the app and broker, during which this data block will populate without the new plan, and again, when it will populate with the new plan.
